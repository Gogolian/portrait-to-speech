# Portrait-to-Speech 🖼️🔊

Welcome to the **Portrait-to-Speech** project! This is an open-source project, licensed under the MIT License, that aims to bring voices to the past through the power of deep learning and creativity. 🤖🎓

Our goal is to use videos of people speaking as training data, then train a transformer model to recognize and infer a voice tone based on a person's appearance. 📹💡 This will allow us to give voice to those who have passed away, for whom we only have images and no voice recordings. 📸🕰️ Imagine having a conversation with historical figures like Einstein, Cleopatra, or Shakespeare! 🚀✨

## Concept 🎉

This project is meant to be a bridge between the past and the present. By using cutting-edge technology, we hope to create an immersive experience that transcends time and connects us with history in a way never before possible. 🌉⏳

The plan is to follow these steps:

1. **Gather video and image datasets**: Collect a diverse dataset of videos containing people speaking with different appearances, voices, and languages.
2. **Preprocess the dataset**: Extract facial features, emotions, and voice tones from the videos. This will enable the model to learn correlations between appearance and voice.
3. **Train a transformer model**: Use the preprocessed dataset to train a transformer model capable of understanding the connections between facial features and voice tones.
4. **Test the model**: Evaluate the model's performance and fine-tune the hyperparameters to improve its accuracy.
5. **Generate voice samples**: Use the trained model to infer voice tones from portrait images of historical figures and generate synthesized speech samples.

Here's a sneak peek at how the project will work:

```python
# Load the trained model
model = load_model("path/to/model")

# Load a portrait image
portrait_image = load_image("path/to/image")

# Infer the voice tone from the portrait image
voice_tone = model.predict(portrait_image)

# Synthesize speech based on the inferred voice tone
synthesized_speech = synthesize_speech(voice_tone, "Hello, I am a historical figure!")

# Save the synthesized speech to a file
save_speech(synthesized_speech, "output.wav")

```
